Signing, Firebase provisioning and screenshots are **one-time human/console
setup**, documented in runbooks. Follow the runbook; do not improvise a
procedure from first principles, and do not invent portal steps.

- Signing / TestFlight → `docs/RUNBOOK-ios-signing.md` +
  `docs/RUNBOOK-ios-signing-CHECKLIST.md`
- Firebase → `docs/RUNBOOK-ios-firebase.md`
- Build / CI / troubleshooting → `docs/RUNBOOK-ios-xcodebuild.md`
- The end-to-end path → `docs/RUNBOOK-ios-release.md`; `docs/README.md` indexes
  the set

## Scope, as it actually is

Two shipping apps: **ELPT** and **AIP** (`com.flygaca.elpt`, `com.flygaca.aip`),
sold together as an App Store bundle. **PPL, CPL, IR and ATPL are paused**
(2026-08-10) — targets, xcconfigs, content, icons, scripts, CI matrices and
screenshots were removed and live in git history only. Their App Store metadata
repos are intact and marked parked, and their **web** study packs are untouched
and still selling. Do not re-add them, and do not "fix" a doc by restoring a
six-app list.

## Commands

```bash
npm run ios:generate              # XcodeGen → apple/FlyGACA.xcodeproj (never committed)
npm run ios:build:<app>           # debug; <app> = elpt|aip
npm run ios:build:release:<app>   # unsigned .xcarchive + dSYM extraction
npm run ios:clean                 # NOTE: does not touch apple/.build/ (archives, dSYMs, IPAs)
npm run firebase:register         # idempotent app registration + plist download (FORCE=1 to overwrite)
npm run sync:content              # pull Content/ + icons from the FlyGACA-app monorepo
```

`scripts/native/xcodebuild-wrapper.sh <app|all|info> [debug|release]` is the
orchestrator: prerequisites → `xcodegen generate` → content (or the committed
snapshot) → `xcodebuild`. It builds from the **committed `Content/` snapshot**
because the bundler lives in the monorepo, not here — that is expected, not a
bug. It also hard-requires a `node` binary on PATH even though this repo has no
bundler for node to run.

Release env flags it honours (CI only): `FG_BUILD_NUMBER`,
`FG_SIGNED_RELEASE=1` (+ `APPLE_TEAM_ID`), `FG_PROVISIONING_PROFILE`,
`FG_UPLOAD_TESTFLIGHT=1` (+ App Store Connect API key env). Debug builds and
unsigned release archives run with `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`, so no Apple
account is needed locally.

## Signing facts that bite

- **Manual signing only.** The App Group entitlement rules out wildcard
  provisioning profiles, so there is no Xcode-managed signing in CI.
- Provisioning profile **names are load-bearing**: `FlyGACA <APP> AppStore`,
  passed as `PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER`.
- `apple/Apps/Shared/App.entitlements` **no longer declares Sign in with Apple**
  (removed 2026-08) — the shipping apps are paid-up-front and fully offline, so
  signing needs only the App Group. Re-adding it means enabling the capability
  on every App ID and regenerating profiles.
- The App Group id is **`group.com.FlyGACA`**, and the three deciding places
  agree: `App.entitlements`, `App-Shared.xcconfig`'s `FG_APP_GROUP`, and
  `PersistenceKit/Persistence.swift`. The portal agrees too — this was an open
  item until run #69 (2026-08-16) signed and uploaded both apps to TestFlight,
  which it could not have done with a mismatched group. **Never "resolve" a
  signing problem by editing the entitlements back.**
- **A build that uploads but won't install is not a build problem.** "The
  requested app is not available or doesn't exist" in TestFlight is the App
  Store lookup failing, not the binary: check the device's Media & Purchases
  account, then Pricing and Availability + age rating on the app record. Full
  checklist in `docs/PORTAL-RUNSHEET-wave1.md` §5.1. Don't re-upload or bump the
  build number to chase it.
- `GoogleService-Info.plist` files are gitignored but **not secret** — they ship
  inside the binary; access is enforced by Firestore rules + App Check. They are
  `optional: true` in `project.yml` so generation and unsigned builds work
  without them.

## CI (`.github/workflows/ios.yml`)

Triggers: pushes to `main`, PRs **targeting** `main`, and `workflow_dispatch` —
a push to a feature branch runs nothing. Jobs: `swift-test` (gates everything),
`xcodegen-validate`, `check-signing` (turns secret presence into a boolean,
because secrets can't be read in a job-level `if:`), `ios-build` (matrix,
`fail-fast: true`), `ios-build-release` (main only), `ios-testflight`
(explicit `elpt`/`aip` matrix, main only, gated on `check-signing`), and
`build-summary` — which `needs` only swift-test / xcodegen-validate / ios-build,
so **a failed release or TestFlight job does not turn it red**. Check those two
directly.

Report: what you ran, the runbook section you followed, and any step that
requires a human in the Apple or Firebase console — name it as human-only rather
than attempting it.
