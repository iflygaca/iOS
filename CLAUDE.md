Guidance for AI coding assistants working in this repository.

## What this is

**ay2m/FlyGACA** is the native SwiftUI home of the Fly GACA study-app family: **one shared
Swift package (`FlyGACAKit`) plus one App Store app target per study module** — ELPT and
AIP — sold together via an App Store **app bundle**. Every app ships the
identical offline feature set (study mode, quizzing, flashcards with spaced repetition,
mock tests, timed scored exam sim with analytics). **A module is data, not code** — adding
an app means adding a `Content/` folder and a ~20-line Xcode target, never new Swift.

> **The licence-exam modules are paused.** PPL, CPL, IR and ATPL were removed from this repo on
> 2026-08-10 pending a strategic decision — targets, xcconfigs, content, icons, scripts, CI
> matrices and screenshot sets. They live in git history only; their App Store metadata repos
> are intact and marked parked, and their **web** study packs are untouched and still selling.
> Do not re-add them, and do not "fix" a doc by restoring a six-app list. Restoring a module is
> a revert of that commit plus its Apple-portal steps — see `ROADMAP.md`.

This repo has **no build step of its own for content or corpus** — it consumes both from
the web monorepo. Read `apple/ARCHITECTURE.md` (the why: target graph, data contracts, App
Store strategy) and `apple/README.md` (the how: Mac setup) before making non-trivial
changes; both are denser and more authoritative than this file for anything Swift-side.

### The Fly GACA repo family

| Repo | Holds |
|---|---|
| **ay2m/FlyGACA** (this repo) | Native iOS app family — FlyGACAKit + the ELPT and AIP app targets |
| `ay2m/FlyGACA` | flygaca.com — React/Vite PWA, Firebase backend, regulatory corpus + content pipelines. **Source of truth** for content (`public/data/`, `src/lib/prepCatalog.ts`) and for `scripts/build-ios-content.mjs` / `npm run ios:icons`, which this repo does not have. |
| `ay2m/Captain-Adel` | The AI flight-instructor service (captadel.com) |
| `iflygaca/FlyGACA-ios` · `ay2m/ELPT` · `ay2m/AIP` (shipping) · `ay2m/PPL` · `ay2m/CPL` · `ay2m/IR` · `ay2m/ATPL` (paused) | Per-app **App Store metadata repos** — store listing copy (EN/AR), screenshots, per-app roadmap. They hold **no source code**; they reference this repo's `apple/Apps/<Module>/` as the code home. If a task is "update the App Store description/screenshots for X", it belongs in that module's own repo, not here. |
| `ay2m/Office` | Business/governance/legal/finance docs |

**This repo is the sole home of the native app code.** The monorepo used to carry a duplicate
`apple/` mirror; it was **retired 2026-08** (`ay2m/FlyGACA` no longer has an `apple/` tree). The
split: this repo owns all Swift + Xcode config (`FlyGACAKit`, `project.yml`, `apple/Scripts`,
`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `README.md`) and hand-edits them here; the monorepo stays the **source of
truth for content only** — its `build-ios-content.mjs` / `gen-app-icons.mjs` generate each app's
`Content/` + `Assets.xcassets` and `scripts/sync-content.sh` pulls them **monorepo → here**, never
the reverse. There is no longer an `--all` mode syncing Swift code (there is nothing upstream to
sync it from).

### The repo docs

Every doc in this repo is now natively owned here (nothing is sync-overwritten anymore):
`CAUSE.md` (mission + the seven principles), `ROADMAP.md` (open work in this repo —
single source of truth), `MIGRATION.md` (the extraction history), `SEO-PLAN.md` (App Store
search / ASO for the shipping apps), `THE-BOOK-OF-FLY-GACA.md` (the whole-family reference — all
ten repos; descriptive, dated, each repo's own docs govern), `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
`docs/RUNBOOK-ios-release.md` (the end-to-end release path), the rest of the `docs/RUNBOOK-ios-*`
set, `docs/CORPUS-SIGNING.md` (the Ed25519 signing procedure for the remote quiz corpus),
`docs/PORTAL-RUNSHEET-wave1.md` (the Apple-portal run sheet), and `docs/README.md` (the doc
index). These originated as copies of the monorepo's versions, but after the `apple/` mirror's
retirement (2026-08) they are the real source, edited here.

`.claude/agents/` defines three subagents scoped to this repo — **swift-kit** (anything inside
`apple/FlyGACAKit`), **parity-guard** (the cross-platform study semantics below) and
**ios-release** (builds, signing, TestFlight, CI, screenshots); `agents/README.md` says when each
is the right one. `.claude/skills/` holds five vendored Apache-2.0 cybersecurity skills curated
for this repo's real security surface — Ed25519 corpus signing, artifact code signing, GitHub
Actions hardening, iOS app assessment and mobile API auth — with provenance, the pinned upstream
commit and the guardrails in `.claude/skills/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`. `.claude/settings.json`
registers the upstream skills marketplace (registered, not enabled).

One caveat on cross-repo links: the monorepo lost its `docs/` tree in 2026-08, so pointers from
here into `ay2m/FlyGACA/docs/…` (e.g. `APPS-FAMILY-ROADMAP.md`, referenced from `ROADMAP.md`) no
longer resolve. Content generation itself is unaffected — `scripts/build-ios-content.mjs`,
`gen-app-icons.mjs`, `public/data/` and `src/lib/prepCatalog.ts` are all still there.

## Architecture (see `apple/ARCHITECTURE.md` for full detail)

**Stack:** Swift 5.9+ tools (the xcconfig's `SWIFT_VERSION = 5.0` is the *language mode*, not the
toolchain; `Package.swift` also declares `.macOS(.v14)` so the package builds/tests from the CLI),
SwiftUI, SwiftData, iOS 17+ floor. MVVM with light Clean layering, as
**one local Swift package with multiple library targets** — no multi-package overhead.
Storage: SwiftData for user state; content is read-only JSON decoded into structs (~152 KB of
committed `Content/` across the two apps — still too small to justify a database).

### Target graph (`apple/FlyGACAKit/Package.swift`)

```
CoreModels (no deps)
  ├─ StudyEngines    (SRS, sessions, streaks, sampler, readiness — no IO)
  ├─ ContentKit      (bundled/cached content loading + signed remote refresh)
  ├─ AppServices     (protocol seams + offline mocks; deps: CoreModels only)
  └─ PersistenceKit  (SwiftData @Model + StudyStore actor;
                      deps: CoreModels, StudyEngines, AppServices)
PlatformLive         (live service implementations; deps: CoreModels, AppServices,
                      PersistenceKit)
FeatureUI (deps: all of the above — every screen, incl. SingleModuleRootView)
```

**`PlatformLive` now exists** — it is no longer a Phase-4 placeholder. It holds
`FirebaseAuthService`, `FirebaseProgressSync`, `CaptainAdelSSEClient`,
`MoyasarPaymentService` and the `PlatformLiveFactory` that builds them. Crucially it
reaches those services over **plain `URLSession` REST** (Firestore's REST API,
`https://flygaca.com/api/chat`, `https://api.moyasar.com/v1/payments`) — there is **no
Firebase or RevenueCat SDK dependency**, so `Package.swift` still declares zero external
packages and `swift build`/`swift test` stay instant. Keep it that way: if you ever need a
real SDK, it goes here and nowhere else.

It is **built but not yet wired**. Nothing in `FeatureUI` references
`PlatformLiveFactory`, and `FlyGACAApp.swift` still constructs only `StudyStore`, so the
shipping apps continue to run entirely on the `AppServices` mocks. Wiring the composition
root is the open work, not writing the implementations.

App targets link **two** products, not one: `FeatureUI` *and* `PersistenceKit` (the shared shell
opens the SwiftData store and constructs `StudyStore` itself — `apple/project.yml`).

Rules that keep this healthy — do not violate them:

- **Engines never do IO.** `StudySession` takes `now: Date` as a parameter; tests pass fixed
  dates. `swift test` needs no simulator, no SDK downloads.
- **Networking and platform SDKs never leak upstream** of `PlatformLive`. Keeps the pure
  targets instant to build and every screen previewable via `AppServices` mocks.
- **UI talks to protocols** (`AuthProviding`, `EntitlementsProviding`, `ProgressSyncing`,
  `ChatClient`, `PaymentProviding` in `AppServices/Services.swift`), not concrete
  implementations. `AppServices/Mocks.swift` provides the offline stand-ins.

### Cross-platform parity — do not break silently

These semantics are shared with the web app (`ay2m/FlyGACA`); users move between platforms:

- **SRS** = a literal port of `src/calc/study/srs.ts`: boxes 0–5, intervals
  `[0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 30]` days, correct promotes (capped), wrong resets to 0, unseen always
  due, mastered = box ≥ 3. Parity vectors: `apple/FlyGACAKit/Tests/StudyEnginesTests/LeitnerTests.swift`.
- **Due dates are UTC day-strings** (`yyyy-mm-dd`, string compare) — a `Calendar.current`
  port would drift a day near midnight.
- **Exam scoring**: `percent = round(correct/total × 100)`, `passed = percent ≥ passMark`
  (default 25 q / 30 min / 75%, per-pack overrides), auto-submit at 0:00, unanswered = wrong.
- **Streak**: web `nextStreak` — same day unchanged, consecutive +1, gap resets.
- The web has **no stable question ids** (progress keyed by array index); `CoreModels`
  fixes this at decode time by hashing `sha256("bankID|prompt")` (first 16 hex chars) →
  `Question.id`, while
  retaining `index`/`legacyKey` for progress parity across content refreshes.

User state lives in SwiftData, in a shared App Group (shared by every app in the family on-device,
so streaks/SRS carry across apps). `StudyStore` (a `@ModelActor`) is the single write path;
SwiftData model objects never escape the actor (they aren't `Sendable`).

> ✅ **App Group id — settled, code and portal agree.** The id is **`group.com.FlyGACA`**, and all
> three places that decide it agree: `apple/Apps/Shared/App.entitlements`, `App-Shared.xcconfig`'s
> `FG_APP_GROUP`, and `PersistenceKit/Persistence.swift`'s `appGroupID`. Eight docs used to say
> `group.com.flygaca.study` instead (this file, `CAUSE.md`, `THE-BOOK-OF-FLY-GACA.md`,
> `apple/README.md`, `apple/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and three runbooks) — all corrected to the code's
> value, since the code is what ships and no code change was made.
>
> **The external half is now confirmed too.** It was open for a while — if the portal really held
> `group.com.flygaca.study`, a profile built from it wouldn't grant what the app requests and the
> signed build would fail (App Groups can't be renamed). Workflow run #69 (2026-08-16) signed,
> exported and uploaded both apps to TestFlight with every step green, and `xcodebuild` validates
> entitlements against the profile at both archive-signing and `-exportArchive` — so the portal
> demonstrably holds `group.com.FlyGACA`. Don't "resolve" anything here by editing the
> entitlements back. Details: `docs/PORTAL-RUNSHEET-wave1.md` §1.1.

## Content: committed snapshots, generated in the monorepo

Each app ships `apple/Apps/<App>/Content/` (`module.json`, `quiz.json`, plus
`groundschool.json` / `paths-index.json` — no current module ships those two; the loaders
treat them as optional). Snapshots can lag the web packs as the corpus moves — a
`sync-content.sh` run closes any gap (last full sync 2026-08-05: ELPT and AIP in step with the
monorepo catalog; ELPT additionally bundles a scenario bank in `quiz-extra.json`).
**This repo owns its Swift code but NOT the content bundler** — `build-ios-content.mjs` /
`gen-app-icons.mjs`, the regulatory corpus (`public/data/`), and the pack catalog
(`src/lib/prepCatalog.ts`) all live in the `ay2m/FlyGACA` monorepo, which stays the source of
truth for content. Here, `Content/` folders and the per-app icons are **committed snapshots**,
refreshed by:

```bash
# with an ay2m/FlyGACA clone next to this repo (default ../FlyGACA), or pass its path
bash scripts/sync-content.sh [path-to-FlyGACA]
```

That shells into the monorepo and runs its generators with `--out apple/Apps` so they write
`Content/` + `Assets.xcassets` **straight into this repo** — no intermediate copy, no `--all`
mode. (Before the mirror's retirement, `--all` also copied the Swift code from the monorepo's
`apple/` tree; that tree is gone and this repo hand-owns its Swift now, so the mode was removed.)
Always review the diff before committing a sync.

`scripts/native/xcodebuild-wrapper.sh` builds from the committed `Content/` snapshot (the bundler
isn't present here — it lives in the monorepo) — this is expected, not a bug.

### Remote refresh is signed, and fails closed

`ContentKit` can refresh `quiz.json` at runtime from `https://flygaca.com/data/quiz.json` into a
cache that `ContentStore` prefers over the bundled snapshot. Because that channel can replace what
every app studies from, it is gated on a **detached Ed25519 signature** — `quiz.json.sig`, base64
over the exact `quiz.json` bytes, served from the same directory and verified with CryptoKit in
`ContentKit/CorpusSignatureVerifier.swift`.

It **fails closed in every failure mode**: a missing/non-200 `.sig`, undecodable base64, a
signature that doesn't match the served bytes, *or* an absent/malformed `FGCorpusPublicKey` in the
app's `Info.plist` all throw `ContentRefreshError.invalidSignature` and leave the existing cache
untouched. Do not "fix" a refresh failure by relaxing the verifier.

> **`FGCorpusPublicKey` is not currently set** — it appears in no xcconfig, plist or workflow in
> this repo. By the rule above that means remote refresh is rejected today and every app runs on
> its bundled `Content/` snapshot. That is the safe state, not a bug, but it does mean the remote
> channel is inert until the key is provisioned.

`scripts/sign-corpus.sh` is the keypair/signing tool (`genkey` to mint the pair and print the
base64 public key for `INFOPLIST_KEY_FGCorpusPublicKey`; `sign` to emit `quiz.json.sig` beside a
corpus). Every publish of `quiz.json` must ship a matching `.sig`. Full procedure:
`docs/CORPUS-SIGNING.md`.

## Build & test commands (verified against `package.json`)

```bash
npm run ios:generate            # scripts/native/ios-generate.sh: XcodeGen → apple/FlyGACA.xcodeproj
                                #   (installs xcodegen via brew/mint if missing)
npm run ios:test                # cd apple/FlyGACAKit && swift test — CAUTION: the &&/|| chain prints
                                #   "Swift not available" and exits 0 even when tests FAIL; run

npm run ios:test:watch          # swift test --watch
npm run ios:build:<app>         # debug build; <app> = elpt|aip
npm run ios:build:all           # debug build, every app
npm run ios:build:release:<app> # unsigned release archive (.xcarchive) + dSYM extraction

npm run ios:clean               # rm -rf FlyGACAKit/.build + Xcode DerivedData for FlyGACA (does NOT
                                #   touch apple/.build/, where archives/dSYMs/IPAs land)
npm run ios:info                # print environment + the available commands
npm run ios:screenshots         # apple/Scripts/html-render/render.js — Mac-free mockups, PORTRAIT only
                                #   (landscape: node apple/Scripts/html-render/render-landscape.js;
                                #    App Store captioned set: node .../render-store.js)
npm run firebase:register       # scripts/native/firebase-register-apps.sh — registers the Firebase iOS apps
npm run sync:content            # bash scripts/sync-content.sh (same as calling the script directly)

# no npm script — call directly:

bash scripts/sign-corpus.sh sign <key> <json> # emit quiz.json.sig beside a corpus
```

The Xcode project (`apple/FlyGACA.xcodeproj`) is **generated, never committed**;
`apple/project.yml` is the source of truth (gitignored: `apple/FlyGACA.xcodeproj/`,
`apple/.build/`, `apple/FlyGACAKit/.build/`). `FlyGACAKit` has zero external dependencies, so
`swift build`/`swift test` need no simulator or SDK downloads — always the fastest way to
verify a Swift-side change:

```bash
cd apple/FlyGACAKit && swift build && swift test
```

`scripts/native/xcodebuild-wrapper.sh <app|all|info> [debug|release] [scheme-override]` is the
orchestrator behind every `ios:build:*` script: checks prerequisites (it hard-requires a `node`
binary on PATH even though this repo has no bundler for node to run) → `xcodegen generate` →
content generation (or snapshot fallback, see above) → `xcodebuild`. Release env flags it honors
(CI-only): `FG_BUILD_NUMBER`, `FG_SIGNED_RELEASE=1` (+ `APPLE_TEAM_ID`),
`FG_PROVISIONING_PROFILE`, `FG_UPLOAD_TESTFLIGHT=1` (+ App Store Connect API key env). Debug
builds and unsigned release archives run with `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO` — no Apple account
needed locally.

## CI (`.github/workflows/ios.yml`)

One workflow, adapted from the monorepo's iOS workflow (no content-validation job — this
repo has no bundler; no `npm ci` — thin `package.json`, zero deps). Triggers are pushes to
`main`, PRs **targeting** `main`, and `workflow_dispatch` — a push to a feature branch runs
nothing. A `concurrency` group (`ios-<ref>`, `cancel-in-progress`) supersedes an in-flight run
on the same ref. All jobs use `actions/checkout@v7` and `actions/upload-artifact@v7`, and run
on `macos-15` unless noted:
nothing. Both event triggers carry `paths-ignore: ['**.md', 'docs/**']`, so a docs-only PR runs
**no jobs at all** and shows zero checks; that's the configuration working, not a stuck queue.
Jobs, all on `macos-15` unless noted:

- **swift-test** — `cd apple/FlyGACAKit && swift test` (all 5 test targets, incl.
  `PlatformLiveTests`). Gates everything else.
- **xcodegen-validate** — installs XcodeGen, `xcodegen generate`, lists schemes.
- **check-signing** (`ubuntu-latest`) — turns presence of `BUILD_CERTIFICATE_BASE64` +
  `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID` secrets into an `enabled` output (secrets can't be read in a
  job-level `if:`), gating `ios-testflight`.
- **ios-build** — matrix of every app, debug (`fail-fast: true` — one app's failure cancels
  the other). Writes a placeholder
  `GoogleService-Info.plist` first (`scripts/native/ci-firebase-placeholder.sh`) since the
  real plists are secrets, not committed. Artifacts retained 7 days.
- **ios-build-release** — every app, unsigned release archive, only on push to `main`.
  Artifacts (`.xcarchive` + dSYMs) retained 14/30 days.
- **ios-testflight** — `elpt` and `aip` (matrix is explicit, not derived from the app list),
  only on `main` push and only when `check-signing` says secrets exist. Imports cert + provisioning profile into a temp keychain, builds signed, exports
  `.ipa`, uploads via `xcrun altool`, cleans up the keychain. Adding an app to this lane needs
  an App ID, a profile and a `PROVISIONING_PROFILE_<APP>_BASE64` secret — see the runbook.
- **build-summary** (`ubuntu-latest`) — rolls up pass/fail into the job summary. It `needs`
  only swift-test/xcodegen-validate/ios-build — a failed release or TestFlight job does
  **not** turn it red.

## Signing, Firebase, and screenshots — where to look, don't improvise

These are one-time human/console setup, not something to script from first principles:

- **Signing / TestFlight** — `docs/RUNBOOK-ios-signing.md` (full walkthrough) +
  `docs/RUNBOOK-ios-signing-CHECKLIST.md` (condensed checklist). Scope is
  `com.flygaca.elpt/.aip`; manual signing (no Xcode-managed signing in CI) because the
  App Group entitlement rules out wildcard provisioning profiles. Nine named GitHub secrets;
  `scripts/native/set-signing-secrets.sh` uploads them from local files via `gh secret set`
  (it takes **exactly four** files — p12 · elpt · aip · p8 — and derives the target repo from
  this checkout's `origin` remote, i.e. `iflygaca/FlyGACA-ios`; it used to hardcode a different
  default, so pass `REPO=` only when you deliberately mean another repo). Provisioning profile names are
  load-bearing (`FlyGACA <APP> AppStore` — passed as `PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER`). Note
  `apple/Apps/Shared/App.entitlements` **no longer declares Sign in with Apple** (removed
  2026-08) — the shipping apps are paid-up-front and fully offline, so signing needs only the
  App Group. Re-adding it means enabling the capability on every App ID and regenerating the
  profiles.
- **Firebase** — `docs/RUNBOOK-ios-firebase.md`. One Firebase project (`flygaca-app`) backs
  both bundle ids; `npm run firebase:register` (`scripts/native/firebase-register-apps.sh`)
  scripts the app registrations + plist downloads (idempotent, never overwrites without
  `FORCE=1`). Sign in with Apple provider setup + APNs key remain manual (no API covers
  Apple's provider/portal). **If sign-in ever ships, grouping the App IDs under one primary is
  load-bearing** — without it, one Apple user signing into two family apps gets two different
  Apple-issued identifiers and two separate Firebase accounts, breaking the shared-account
  model the App Group is built for. That primary is **`com.flygaca.elpt`** — every doc now says
  so (`RUNBOOK-ios-firebase.md` §4a, `PORTAL-RUNSHEET-wave1.md` §1.2,
  `RUNBOOK-ios-release.md`), and the old `com.flygaca.ppl` designation is recorded as moot: the
  App IDs never carried the capability, so no Apple user identifier was issued under it. Only the
  portal work is outstanding.
  `GoogleService-Info.plist`
  files are gitignored (`apple/Apps/*/GoogleService-Info.plist`) but not secret — they ship
  inside the app binary; access is enforced by Firestore rules + App Check, not file secrecy.
  They're declared `optional: true` in `project.yml` so generation/unsigned builds work
  without them.
- **Screenshots** — two independent pipelines under `apple/Scripts/`:
  - `apple/Scripts/html-render/` — Mac-free HTML/CSS mockups via Playwright + Chromium,
    with three entry points over one shared screen library:
    `render.js` (portrait, what `npm run ios:screenshots` runs), `render-landscape.js`
    (landscape, by hand), and `render-store.js` (the **App Store** sequence — wraps the
    faithful base screens in marketing caption bands from `captions.js` and reorders them
    value-prop first; this is the set that ships to the per-app metadata repos).
    The per-screen work lives in `screens.js` (one function per screen, palette copied
    verbatim from `FeatureUI/Theme.swift`, content read live from
    `Apps/<App>/Content/*.json`) — `render-store.js` leaves it untouched, so edit `screens.js`
    for fidelity and `captions.js` for copy. Its README documents the output contract and a
    screen-fn ↔ SwiftUI-source parity table to update when a view changes.
  - `apple/Scripts/capture-screenshots.sh` + `process-screenshots.sh` — real simulator
    captures (pixel-exact, needs a Mac + Xcode). `AppleTests/ScreenshotTests.swift` documents
    the `XCUITest` snapshot flow and is wired into `apple/project.yml` as `AppleTests`
    (`testTargets: [AppleTests]`).

## Conventions & gotchas worth knowing before editing

- **PlatformLive is written but not wired in.** The target and its four service
  implementations exist (see the target graph above), yet no screen constructs them, so the
  apps are still fully offline by design and the `AppServices` mocks (`Mocks.swift`) *are*
  the shipping product. Live services are injected at the composition root
  (`FlyGACAApp.swift` / `SingleModuleRootView`) when that work lands — do not scatter
  `PlatformLiveFactory` calls through `FeatureUI`, and do not add SDK imports outside
  `PlatformLive`. Note `ARCHITECTURE.md` §5 still describes PlatformLive as unbuilt Phase-4
  work; the code is ahead of that doc.
- **The apps still ship on mocks.** `PlatformLive` exists and is tested, but nothing injects it
  (see above), so `AppServices`'s `Mocks.swift` *is* the shipping product and the apps are fully
  offline by design. Keep any new platform integration inside `PlatformLive`.
- **`FlyGACAApp.swift` (`apple/Apps/Shared/`) is the one app shell for every target.**
  Never fork it per app; per-app differences are xcconfig values (`FG_MODULE_ID`, bundle id,
  display name) injected via `Info.plist`, not code.
- **Adding a new module app is a data/config change, not a Swift change**: new pack entry in
  the monorepo's `prepCatalog.ts` → `Content/` synced here → a 3-line `apple/project.yml`
  target + a small `.xcconfig` → `npm run ios:generate`. AIP is the worked example.
- **XcodeGen emits the Xcode 16 project format** (`objectVersion 77`) — open/build with Xcode
  16+ only; CI pins `macos-15` runners for this reason. `apple/project.yml`'s own comment is
  authoritative, and `apple/README.md:1` now agrees (it used to say "Xcode 15+").
- **`docs/RUNBOOK-ios-*.md`, `apple/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `apple/README.md` are now natively
  owned here** (they began as copies of the monorepo's, but the `apple/` mirror was retired
  2026-08, so this is the real source — edit them here). A couple still describe the *content*
  bundler (`build-ios-content.mjs`, `npm run ios:icons`) as if present in this repo; it isn't —
  it lives in the monorepo and `scripts/sync-content.sh` invokes it. `docs/RUNBOOK-ios-release.md`
  is the release path; `docs/README.md` indexes the set. `docs/RUNBOOK-ios-xcodebuild.md` is the
  build/CI/troubleshooting reference (incl. "Adding a New iOS App") — but its Phase Roadmap
  numbers phases differently from `ARCHITECTURE.md` §5: its "Phase 4 ✅" is the signing/TestFlight
  slice, **not** PlatformLive.
- **Tests span 5 targets / 11 files** — `CoreModelsTests` (ModuleManifest, QuizDecode),
  `StudyEnginesTests` (Leitner, Readiness, Sampler, Session, Streak), `ContentKitTests`
  (ContentLoader, ContentRefresher), `PersistenceKitTests` (StudyStore) and
  `PlatformLiveTests` — not just the SRS parity vectors.
  (ContentLoader, ContentRefresher), `PersistenceKitTests` (StudyStore) and `PlatformLiveTests`
  — not just the SRS parity vectors.
- **License:** MIT, © BDA Company International, operating as Fly GACA.
- Per-app bundle ids follow `com.flygaca.<lowercase module>`; module ids (`FG_MODULE_ID`,
  e.g. `elp`, `aip`) are the pack ids from the monorepo's
  `prepCatalog.ts` and must match exactly — verify with the loop in
  `docs/RUNBOOK-ios-firebase.md` §2 if plists ever look swapped.
- No `node_modules`/JS dependencies beyond the optional Playwright screenshot renderer —
  `package.json` exists purely as an npm-script dispatcher for the shell/Swift tooling above.
